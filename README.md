# RMM_Product_Selector
This project is a product selector. This was made to give Sales employees the ability to add new products to a database and have what they entered into the database automatically populate on a customer facing page. 

This was my final project for Coding Dojo's Python section. This code is currently being applied to the Toray CMA website's Product Selector section. The update should be made in the coming months. 

*Please note that this project's CSS is still being worked on as this is now a personal project for myself. Toray CMA has website standards and templates they must use and comply with*
